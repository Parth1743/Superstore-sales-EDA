# Superstore Sales Data Analysis & Forecasting

This repository contains a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Sales Forecasting** model for a Superstore sales dataset. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and building a predictive model to forecast future sales based on historical data.

---

## Project Overview

The **Superstore Sales Data** consists of various sales transactions, including information about customers, products, regions, sales, profit, and more. The project aims to perform the following tasks:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data, data type conversion, and feature extraction.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to enhance model prediction capabilities.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize key insights and trends within the dataset.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Build a model to predict future sales using regression techniques.
  
---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models (Linear Regression).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parth1743/Superstore-sales-EDA.git
```

2. **Download the dataset** from [Kaggle - Superstore Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishanshrivastava28/superstore-sales) and place it in the root directory.

3. **Run the code**:
   - Open the Jupyter notebook or execute the `Main.py` script to perform the analysis and forecasting.

## Key Insights from EDA

- **Sales Trends**: Monthly sales show an increasing trend with periodic fluctuations.
- **Profitability**: Profit margins are closely related to the sales category and discount offered.
- **Customer Segments**: High-value customers significantly contribute to the overall sales.
  
You can find all the visualizations and insights within the `Main.py` script.

## Sales Forecasting Model

The model uses **Linear Regression** to predict future sales based on the following features:

- `Month`
- `Day of Week`
- `Discount-to-Sales Ratio`
- `Profit Margin`

### Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using two metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

The current model's performance on the test set:
- **MAE**: 266.92
- **RMSE**: 631.11

These metrics indicate that the model has room for improvement, and we can explore advanced techniques like Random Forest, XGBoost, or ARIMA for better accuracy.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implementing techniques like **GridSearchCV** to optimize model performance.
- **Advanced Models**: Experimenting with models such as **Random Forest Regressor** and **XGBoost**.
- **Time-Series Forecasting**: Using specialized models such as **ARIMA** or **LSTM** for better handling of time-series data.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzing customer behavior to create more targeted sales strategies.
